3
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:19,422
the kneecap. It is caused by overuse,

4
00:00:19,518 --> 00:00:23,870

you will see why. The ligaments of the ankle holds the ankle

10
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:43,798
bones and joint in position. They protect the ankle

11
00:00:43,846 --> 00:00:46,870
from abnormal movements such as twisting, turning and

12
00:00:46,902 --> 00:00:50,710
rolling of the foot. A sprained ankle happens when the

13
00:00:50,742 --> 00:00:54,434
foot twists, rolls or turns beyond its normal motions.

14
00:00:55,484 --> 00:00:58,864

16
00:01:03,004 --> 00:01:05,784

shin bone and your thigh bone.

22
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:28,888

Anterior cruciate ligament tear occurs when your foot

43
00:02:43,362 --> 00:02:46,714
